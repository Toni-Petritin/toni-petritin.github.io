                    <h1>MechSuit</h1>

                    <h2>1. Project Description</h2>
                    <p>This is a project for XGS (Xamk Game Studios) 2023 Summer Internship. The goal of the project was to explore bHaptics haptic gear capabilities, which XGS had acquired.</p>
                    <p>We chose to explore this with a VR game, where the player pilots a mech and can feel everything the mech feels. These haptic events included falling, footsteps, firing guns, getting fired at, etc.</p>
                    <p><b>Client:</b> Xamk Game Studios</p>
                    <p><b>Team and Roles:</b></p>
                    <p>Toni Tiilikainen - team lead, programmer, technical artist</p>
                    <p>Meri NÃ¤si - designer, artist</p>
                    <p>Camila Motta - artist, sound producer</p>

                    <p><b>Design:</b> The original idea was mine. Meri did most of the art design and I did the gameplay & technical design. Otherwise the design process was a team effort.</p>
                    <p>The design focus early on was in environmental effects. Yet, after the first public playtesting there were a lot of people, who wanted a more combat oriented approach. This changed our focus in the second half of the project to creating enemies and creating more varried mech weaponry.</p>
                    <p><b>Achieved:</b> All initial requirements set out by the client were met. The goals placed by our own team were met partially as we set a relatively high bar for ourselves. We had to cut underwater content and story content.</p>
                    <p><b>Future:</b> The project is ongoing in terms of each team member wanting to continue with it. The problem is each member has been busy with school.</p>
                    <p><b>Schedule:</b> The timeframe set out by the client for the project was around three and a half months.</p>
