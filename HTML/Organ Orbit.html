                    <h1>XGJ22 - Organ Orbit</h1>
                    <h2>1. Project Description</h2>
                    <p>This was a game for the Xamk Game Jam 2022 with a 48 hour time limit. The theme was a picture, which I never saved anywhere. Brief description would be: a surrealistic cartoon image of a steampunk organ (insturment) attached to a planet(s).</p>
                    <p><b>Team and Roles:</b></p>
                    <p>Joni Helen - lead designer, programmer</p>
                    <p>Harto Kuukka - lead programmer</p>
                    <p>Toni Tiilikainen - programmer</p>
                    <p>Ida Rask - sound and UI design</p>
                    <p>Essi Kykk√§nen - graphic design</p>
                    <p>Miia Jeskanen - 3d modelling</p>
                    <p><b>Design:</b> As usual with jams, the initial design is very much a group effort. The primary idea however was Joni's and this is why I gave him the title of lead designer. I personally pushed the idea towards more closely resemble the theme, because to me that is the whole point of a jam</p>
                    <p>We ended up with a physics platformer, where you control devices in the game world to move a glass ball (visually a planet) through the level to be shot out into the orbit of a star. The controls were the keys of an organ, which actually played music as you pressed buttons on your keyboard.</p>
                    <p><b>Achieved:</b> All the desired game mechanics were finished on time along with one introductory level.</p>
                    <p><b>Future:</b> Personally, I would have loved to continue to create more levels and make a more modular base for the game. However, I was less inclined to do so alone and the rest of the team was interested yet reserved over the idea. I left the project on a backburner in hopes interest were to manifest, but alas it never did.</p>
                    
                    <h2>2. My Tasks</h2>
                    <p><b>Planet orbit:</b> I had the very simple task of programming the planet to be shot out of the level and then dynamically find an orbit around the star.</p>

                    <h2>3. Problems and Solutions</h2>
                    <p><b>Scriptable objects:</b> At this point I didn't really know how scriptable objects worked. The solution was to learn and then implement.</p>
                    <p><b>Integrating code:</b> This never turned out to be an issue, but it was something I was nervous about as I was still relatively inexperienced in combining my code with the code of other people.</p>
                    <p><b>Orbit math:</b> Was never really an issue, but taught me some lessons about programming lerp.</p>
                    
                    <h2>4. Testing</h2>
                    <p>Surface level ad hoc testing during jam.</p>
                    
                    <h2>5. Screenshots</h2>
                    <p>The game doesn't work properly on my pc, so I can't really offer very interesting screenshots, but here's the starting screen of the first and only level.</p>

                    <h2>7. Conclusions</h2>
                    <p>Although I worked only a little over ten hours on this project, it was very rewarding and educational. We all had fun, there was no crunch, the game turned out super fun, and we were able to pretty much finish all the mechanics of the game.</p>
