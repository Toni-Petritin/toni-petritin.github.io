                    <h2>Who</h2>
                    <p>- <b>Toni Tiilikainen</b>.</p>
                    <p>- <b>Bachelor of Engineering</b> in Game Programming.</p>
                    <p>- <b>Master's degree</b> in mathematical logic.</p>
                    <p>- In the picture I'm the one in the back.</p>

                    <h2>Why the above</h2>
                    <p>I've always loved creative problem solving, modelling complex systems, and telling stories.
                        Games are all of those things and math is at least two of those.
                    </p>
                    <p>Name I didn't choose, but haven't found anything to complain about.</p>

                        <p>This is the first game, where we had actual artists and designers (albeit all students), and not just programmers. I jumped on board in August of 2022, but the game had been in early development for some time before that already.</p>
                        <p>Norowareta is a first person horror game with retro aesthetics. My roles were programmer and level designer.</p>

                    <h1>Tabletop RPG Rule & World Design</h1>
                        <p>Although all of these were hobby projects rather than commercial ones, I still consider them worth mentioning as they are full rulesets and worlds designed by me from the ground up.</p>
                        <p>I learned a considerable amount about <b>numerical game design balancing</b>, narrative design, and player experience from these projects.</p>

                        <li>World-building and lore creation</li>

                        <li>Numerical balancing and playtesting</li>
                        <li>Use of tools like spreadsheets and custom software for design</li>

                    <div class="collapsecontent">
                        <p>A narrative-focused RPG that approaches storytelling with a similar take as FateCore.</p>

                        <p>"For fun", but I took few project hours for school, which is why the report is also more in-depth.</p>
                        <p>I went with a sci-fi theme, which posed a number of new challenges. These challenges included a far more vast item list than I have usually needed, and a more varied list of organizations and factions to make the world more believable in a far more connected interstellar environment.</p>

                    <div class="collapsecontent">
                        <p>A horror rpg set in a fictional late nineteenth century era world called Riverside.</p>
                        <p>The rule set went through a couple of iterations during development and testing. This was due to the system being very tightly specced to model a very specific type of combat and skill usage to accommodate the horror theme.</p>
                    </div>

                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Divine Wars (2008-2014)</button>
                    <div class="collapsecontent">
                        <p>Divine Wars is a fantasy roleplaying game I designed to span over countless worlds ruled by a selection of near godlike species of monsters. The players themselves play members of one of these godlike species - there are several selections, but all players canonically have to be from the same species per campaign.</p>
                        <p>The system functioned predominantly on top of a foundational set of rules, which each species altered somewhat to accommodate their individual power levels and skill sets. Subsequently each of these altered rulesets were called by a different name based on the species theme. The title "Divine Wars" is an umbrella term I made up to cover all these variations.</p>

                    <div class="collapsecontent">
                        <p>This was my very first full rpg I designed from the ground up with its own rules and world.</p>
                        <p>Third World is a relatively standard fantasy rpg set in a world where two groups of gods had been exiled after their attempted rebellion against the greater gods.</p>
                        <p>None of the original design documents have survived the test of time. The rulesets were clunky, but functional. The document for the world desing was around 40-50 pages long.</p>

                    <h1>Drawings</h1>
                    <p>These are some snippets of my drawings over the years. I don't claim to be an artist, but I think I can manage some conceptual art to a point, if need arises.</p>
                    <p>Categories are in reverse chronological order (=newest at the top). Inside the categories read from top to bottom (to ease readability).</p>
